Recruitment Statement for Research Participation

 
1. Jack Friedrich, Saint Louis University Psychology Graduate Student, is inviting you to participate in this research study.



2. The title of this study is More than Perverse Incentives: Questionable Research Practices in the Organizational Sciences. The purpose of this study is to better understand research practices used in the organizational sciences and their relationship with various social norms and experiences of publication pressure.



3. Your participation in this study will involve completing an online survey that will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. The survey will ask about your experiences related to various research practices and with publication pressure.



4. To be eligible for this study, you must be a researcher in the organizational sciences, have conducted quantitative research that involves null hypothesis significance testing, and be at least 18 years of age.



5. The risks to you as a participant are minimal. These include loss of confidentiality, boredom/fatigue, loss of time, and potential discomfort in answering questions about yourself. To minimize risk, your responses will be anonymous (no identifying information will be collected), the questions will not assess illegal or sensitive topics, and you are free to skip any questions you are uncomfortable responding to.



6. The results of this study may be published in scientific research journals or presented at professional conferences. However, your name and identity will not be revealed and your record will remain anonymous.



7. Participation in this study will not benefit you directly. Your participant may benefit others by helping us understand the relationships between publication pressure, social norms, and various research practices in the organizational sciences.



8. You can choose not to participate. If you decide not to participate, there will not be a penalty to you or loss of any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You may withdraw from this study at any time.



9. If you have questions about this research study, you can email Jack Friedrich at jack.friedrich@slu.edu. If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, you can call the Saint Louis University Institutional Review Board at 314-977-7744 and reference IRB #34401.

By clicking ""I agree,"" you are consenting to the conditions described above.",Have you conducted quantitative research that involves null-hypothesis significance testing?,Are you at least 18 years of age?,Which of the following best describes your current position?,Which of the following best describes your current academic appointment? - Selected Choice,Which of the following best describes your current academic appointment? - Other (please describe) - Text,How would you describe your gender identity? - Selected Choice,How would you describe your gender identity? - Other (please describe) - Text,Are you a member of an ethnic minority in your country?,List of Countries,"Dr. Patel is conducting research on the relationship between psychological safety and employee voice behaviors. Her planned analyses yield significant effects that are consistent with the literature but not particularly novel. During an exploratory analysis she discovers a significant, unexpected effect for certain groups in her dataset that is much more compelling than her original hypotheses and if it were the focus of the paper would likely strengthen the impact and publishability of her paper, particularly in a top-tier journal. In her place, would you: - 4","Dr. Garcia is conducting a lab study with two conditions. He is randomly assigning members to a leadership style and examining the impact of the style on team performance. The study is expensive and time-intensive to run. He preregistered that he would collect data from 40 teams, but he is running analyses after every fifth team’s data collection and obtains a significant result after collecting data from the 30th team. In his place, would you: - 4","Dr. Anderson finally finishes data collection for his study on factors contributing to burnout at work for a hard-to-study population, but unfortunately responses to many of his key variables have very high degrees of missingness. He decides to fill missing values in his dataset with estimated values, using a very common imputation method, but the degree of missingness in his data is slightly higher than recommended for use with this method. In his place, would you: - 1","Dr. Thompson is conducting research on the relationship between job satisfaction, work engagement, and the outcome of employee turnover. Upon running her analyses, Dr. Thompson is surprised to discover that the analysis she had originally chosen and that she believes is most appropriate for her data, a multiple logistic regression, returns a null effect. There are, however, several other plausible analyses she could run. In her place, would you: - 1","Dr. Lewis is running the analyses for her study on remote work. Her regression model includes a number of covariates that she hypothesized would be related to experiences of remote work, but she discovers that some of the covariates’ effects on experiences of remote work are non-significant. In her place, would you: - 1","Dr. Walker is studying the influence of personality traits on work-life balance. He obtains a non-significant correlation of r = .21 and p = .054 for what he believed would be his strongest result. After this result, he examines the scatterplot for the correlation and notices that a few datapoints that he could justify as outliers are preventing his results from reaching statistical significance. In his place, would you: - 1","Dr. Xu is studying the impact of job characteristics on employee strengths use. Some of her analyses yield negligible, non-significant effects. After reviewing her results, she believes the analyses that demonstrated null effects may not be relevant to the story she is telling in her planned publication. In her place, would you: - 1","Dr. Taylor runs multiple, well-powered studies testing hypotheses consistent with a very well-established theory of work motivation. Reviewing his results, Dr. Taylor is surprised to find that the results of some of his studies are non-significant and inconsistent with the theory. In his place, would you: - 1","Dr. King is applying for an academic job a few years after graduation and decides to publish her dissertation on the impact of workplace bullying on worker outcomes such as job turnover, satisfaction, and engagement. Several outcome variables in her original dissertation study were non-significant, and upon revisiting the topic in her dissertation, she deems them less relevant to the topic than she did when originally conducting the study. In her place, would you: - 1","The result of Dr. Bell’s key hypothesis test in his most recent research project examining predictors of organizational citizenship behaviors is right above the threshold for statistical significance at p = .053. He believes the result indicates there is an effect but worries that a technically non-significant finding will result in a rejection at the journal that best fits the study’s topic. In his place, would you: - 1","Dr. Carter’s paper exploring predictors of employee experiences of inclusion is ready for submission for publication when she discovers a data quality issue that could impact some of her conclusions and likelihood of publication; most of her participants gave inconsistent responses in her online data collection. She could recollect data, but it would require more additional time and resources than she has available. However, she worries that disclosing the issue would impact her likelihood of publication. In her place, would you: - 1","To ensure you are paying attention, please select ""Agree"".","What PERCENT of organizational scientists (e.g., management scholars, industrial-organizational psychologists, etc.)–that is how many out of 100–would you say have engaged in this practice on at least one occasion?

But in addition, I conduct more robustness checks and exploratory analyses. Some of those may end reported in an appendix/online supplement, or they may lead to a follow-up study -- or they may not be interesting enough to report. In some cases, I have used the results of analyses only in response letters to reviewers. Ultimately, there are many exploratory questions one could ask, and I make the data publicly available for people who want to play with the data themselves.

Similarly with not reporting studies. In some cases, reviewers ask for studies to be redone with some changes. Occasionally, the original version is worth including in an online supplement. But in nearly all cases in my experience, the results remained unchanged and the old version gets dropped from the paper to avoid being repetitive.

For example, when methods did not yield significant results, another option is to sell the results in a ""short paper"" or ""research in progress paper"" at an academic conference. While academic conferences are not that established in business and social sciences, in business information systems there are a lot of established (and also internationally ranked) conferences, where some parts of the results (e.g., from a journal article to be published) can be published. However, in my humble opinion, academic pressure and the rather corrput system based on ""who you know"" in conjunction with the rather formal ranking of journals/publications puts more pressure on PhD candidates, as quantity seems to be more important than quality, ultimately leading to the pressure to publish or perish. In addition, the review culture in major journals is quite bad (and there are also a lot of articles online about this issue), as science is more about publications and reputation, rather than focussing on epistemological processes.

It takes months in my discipline to make sure the data is free from error and initial data analyses will direct towards errors. Sometimes the researcher has inappropriate theory and unexpected results will draw attention to this. A researcher might change their statistical techniques if they adopted inappropriate ones initially.  Non significant results could be interesting. You might leave out non significant results because their are  highly correlated with other variables and that gives multicollinearity if you are using multivariate analyzes. You might not know this until you start analyzing the data. Research is a major benefit to society so it is important to show integrity. That does not mean reporting all results as the paper must be contained in about 50 pages. Gaining publication should not be the overreaching outcome.

The first step in any project should be data exploration and I do not think that all the scatterplots need to be reported, for example. Similarly, when using complex analysis techniques such as SEM you might need to manually specify starting values. To find good starting values, doing a simpler analysis first is a good practice. Likewise, you might want to diagnose a complex model by checking if you get similar results using a simpler model. I do not think that all these need to be reported.

The same applies to selective reporting. If I were to write a dissertation that contains 50 models, but I know that In a journal article I can only fit 10 models, then I must report the reports selectively to hit the page limit. It is always possible to link to the dissertation for the full set of analyses, but probably most readers of the journal article would not read it...

Another contextual issue that the survey omitted is pressure from the family. Some academics have spouses in academia and publish together.

There are situations, when you collect more data, e.g. 2-3 studies in one data collection. In this event, you don't report the variables as they were from another study. But the reason is the funding when people have to combine data collections. Is it a bad practice? According to your questions - it might be.

2. It depends on what you understand as covariates. If they are part of the hypotheses - they should be reported. But if you have several control variables (usual suspects like age and gender, but also experience, experience in a particular firm, experience in a particular field, education, etc) you may decide that reporting all covariates just overloads paper with unnecessary information. So, regarding your question on covariates - I would say ""it depends"".

4. Regarding moving to other methods. You usually start with a correlation, then ANOVA, and then move to Multivariate analysis, where you can add more control variables. I don't know studies where people jumped into analysis before running other analyses like outliers check, missing variables check, correlation, ANOVA, etc. Yet, the significance may change if you add more controls or if you switch from ANOVA to coding a variable as a dummy and run a regression. The procedures are slightly different. The vinal p-values will differ but only slightly. I am not sure you meant this practice, when you asked the question about switching between methods.

Good luck with your research! And, btw, my colleagues don'T show me their analyses or do it seldom.

I decided to answer them in the context that I am used to in my discipline, namely, that studies (especially those to be published in top journals) need to be preregistered and come with replication packages. Such studies also allow for exploratory analysis and results, which are defined as anything that has not been preregistered. Eventually, everything that has been preregistered needs to be reported. But it is allowed to add (or not to add) anything beyond the preregistration, marked as exploratory. Readers then can interpret these results as such. Given that preregistrations and replication packages are public, the process is transparent. Because of replication packages, it is also impossible to ""mis-report p-values"" or ""simulate data without indication"".

Obviously, rounding down p values and the like is very bad (and dumb). But the stuff about statistical analyses, handling outliers, running various models, or including or not including insignificant results. It can depend on the theory you're testing, reviewer recommendations, and a whole bunch of other things. 

Research is a two-sided market. If I've got reviewers who recommend dropping a hypothesis or running a different analysis, I'm going to follow those recommendations, if they make sense.

The vignettes were pretty representative of situations that researchers often face, although a few of them could have used more context. The role of replication was missing in the vignettes. Of course, you can’t include everything in your study, so I understand why this was omitted. My approach to research is to plan to conduct multiple studies from the outset. If something unexpected occurs in an earlier study, I’m transparent in my Results section about that unexpected result. In a subsequent study I attempt to replicate the unexpected result, often after making improvements to the methods I used in the earlier study. I often also report results multiple ways (e.g., we found x when careless participants were included, and y when careless participants were omitted; we found a when we included all planned covariates, and b when we omitted one or more planned covariates). In short, my view is that researchers must provide an honest and complete account of what they did. I would encourage researches to pivot when their study doesn’t go as planned (which happens a lot!!!); however, they should be clear in their research report that they have pivoted and they should consider conducting one or more follow-up studies in an effort to replicate and better understand any previous unexpected results.

I would impute items by computing my scale by averaging across items, but I wouldn't impute a scale. Or, like would I stop collecting after reaching significance. I always collect after reaching significance because I always use my whole budget. I think it was maybe worded in reverse, like we're supposed to keep collecting, but I had trouble evaluating that one. Similarly, maybe you should remove an outlier, including ones that help your hypothesis. So, some of them were hard to think about because it could be a good context. And I think I've internalized the horrible practice of not reporting all data or the Chrysallis Effect (e.g. Cortina, 2016). I take responsibility for that. But I really don't want to read through 10 pages of a paper just to find that nothing worked when I get to the results. That's rarely a contribution to my knowledge and rarely a good use of my time, frankly. There are so many reasons it might not have worked, like maybe it was a bad study or the sample size was too small. So I think that null results tell me less than significant results. That said, I've had conversations with other researchers at SIOP and three people will tell me the same thing- they can't get Schwartz's values scale to predict anything, or they can't measure OCB motives- those are two that come to mind. So, I think those have a place in dissertations so that other researchers won't waste their time trying to study that, but it's so hard to get even moderate impact articles published.

For example, it used to be the norm that one didn't report the exact p value, just whether it was above or below the criterion, so of course I have some publications for which that is what I did. Before the invention of supplementary material, it also was not uncommon only to put statistically significant results into a publication for space reasons, and there was no way to make other information available to readers. Things have changed.  I found myself wanting to explain this type of thing often in responding to the scenarios. 

There were several scenarios for which I could think of third alternatives, or nuances to the choices. For example, it can happen that after doing analysis A, I realized that there exists a different legitimate model that I had not previously understood, so I did B and reported that instead because it provided a clearer test of the concept. Not because it achieved a publishable result, but because it was more logical. I have also experienced instances in which a new statistical model was suggested by a reviewer, so we changed the analytic model between the initial submission and a revision to respond to the reviewer. 

There is an ethical argument in favour of a stopping rule (testing the data and stopping earlier than planned if the result emerges). Medical research uses this approach because it is unethical to deny a useful treatment once one knows about it. Even for organizational research (for which the consequences are not life-and-death), the continued use of resources including participant time and effort needs justification. This also had no way to be communicated as part of your scenarios.

Every researcher has a stack of papers they haven't had time to write. One chooses to spend time on those that are most likely to make a real contribution, which often are the reports that supported one's theory. Yes, sometimes this is suppressing null or negative results; but not always.

All of which is to say, I am not convinced that slavish devotion to an initially registered plan is the best route to good research. Gaming the system to make one's ideas look good (e.g., by suppressing variables from a report if they are not giving the desired result) is unacceptable; but the conduct and reporting of good research does involve nuanced choices.",End survey,Rewrite your introduction to suggest that this effect was hypothesized originally to improve the paper’s publishability,Close data collection after obtaining the significant result,Disclose the imputation in your methods section,Switch to a different analysis method until you find a significant result,Report all covariates in the model regardless of significance,Rerun the analyses and report those results if they are significant,Report only those results that are relevant to the story you want to tell in the publication,"Report all studies you ran, regardless of consistency with the theory",Report all outcomes regardless of significance,Report the p-value without rounding when submitting for publication,Mention the data quality issue

This research focuses a lot on p-hacking. The scholarly community I work with often emphasises the size of effects reported beyond statistical significance, given that statistical significance is sample size dependent. Confidence intervals are much more informative than statistical significance levels, especially if you have sufficient statistical power for your analysis. Understanding the limitations around significance reporting could immunize scholars against the need to obsess about significance reporting. That said, perhaps attempts would be made to inflate effect sizes.",End survey,"Report the original hypotheses and results but integrate the unexpected finding as a secondary analysis, suggesting it could be the basis for future research",Close data collection after obtaining the significant result,Disclose the imputation in your methods section,Simply report the results from your initial analysis,Report all covariates in the model regardless of significance,Rerun the analyses and report those results if they are significant,Report only those results that are relevant to the story you want to tell in the publication,"Report only those studies that 'worked' (i.e., consistent with the motivation theory)","Highlight only the relevant, significant outcomes",Round down the p-value to meet the significance threshold when submitting for publication,Mention the data quality issue

For example, my understanding is that a result is not significant if p = .05, which would mean writing p = .053 as p = .05 doesn't change the significance level of the result.  Also, in my doctoral program, I was taught to collect more data than your hypothesis includes because many results are null, so the extra data may help you find something interesting in your data that can be helpful for science, can lead to additional studies, or at the very least could be a future research idea for another paper.  I think the problem is less that researchers are trying to be unethical but the bigger problem is that many publications don't want to publish null results.  But null results are important and should be published because they tell us something about the theories we're testing, including boundary conditions!  If null results are rarely or never published, scientists are potentially running the same experiments over and over not knowing that they should expect null results or that someone else already found null results that would have informed the theory and helped scientists to make progress on understanding their phenomenon better.",End survey,"Report the original hypotheses and results but integrate the unexpected finding as a secondary analysis, suggesting it could be the basis for future research",Continue collecting data as preregistered,Report your findings without noting the imputation,Simply report the results from your initial analysis,Exclude non-significant covariates from your final paper submission,Rerun the analyses and report those results if they are significant,Report only those results that are relevant to the story you want to tell in the publication,"Report all studies you ran, regardless of consistency with the theory",Report all outcomes regardless of significance,Report the p-value without rounding when submitting for publication,Omit mentioning this data quality issue

I think I misunderstood the not reporting covariates. During the vignettes I thought it meant rerunning analyses without it then reporting those. But then for the second part of the study (my practices/others) I thought it was reporting the analyses that included the covariates, but not reporting the covariates (which is obviously much worse). Sorry for my confusion.
2. I think a lot of these practices are on a gradient. So it's hard to lump them in together.
3. Many of these practices are explicitly/implicitly asked for by reviewers/editors. 
4. I prefer transparency in reporting, so I might provide some of these additional details/analyses in online supplementary information. I prefer running with/without controls, for example, and report one in the main manuscript and the other in online supplementary materials.

I'd like to mention that some of the scenarios/questions could be interpreted in several ways, so be cautious in your interpretations. For example, when the first analysis doesn't reveal the expected results, you should run additional analyses to find out what was going on. But, you should be transparent about this! Similarly, omitting insignificant statistical control variables (ie covariates) could be reasonable in response to the limited word count in most journals. I have no issue with this, if you refer to an appendix with the full analysis or at least mention that the respective analyses did not yield different results than the one in the full text. What I try to illustrate with these examples is that there are grey areas which fall in between your scenarios and without the respective information in the vignette, respondents might answer to different situations.

Also, I am curious to read about your findings. This is an interesting study. For what it's worth, I do believe the ""publish or perish"" mentality has already killed science. Peer reviewers are trained to reward good stories and to punish the scientific process. We either want discussions of the complex decisions that went into generating final results or we don't--the way peer review works now, it is clear that we don't; we only say we do in methods classes.

The question of whether to collect more data when results lack statistical significance is interesting.

I understand that establishing percentages related to the use of third-party practices or our own is aimed at providing a quantitative foundation, but I found it quite difficult to accurately estimate these numbers. I believe it is important to consider scientific collaboration, as I have often worked with authors who engage in such practices, and I sometimes feel ""forced"" to adopt practices that make me uncomfortable or that I consider inadequate.

On one hand, I am currently less involved in scientific research, focusing more on academic management and teaching, having recently transitioned to this role in 2022. In this position, the pressure to publish is nearly nonexistent, except for my own desire to explore certain topics and studies. However, at the moment, I have very little time for traditional academic activities, including research.

On the other hand, prior to this transition, I spent the last eight years as a professor at a federal university in Brazil. In this context, we enjoy full job security (similar to tenure), with guaranteed career advancement requiring minimal effort. As a result, those who publish extensively typically do so for personal reasons, such as ego, rather than to advance their careers, since career progression is practically guaranteed with minimal effort. 
This situation is different from countries like the USA, where career advancement and achieving job security often depend on having a significant volume of scientific output. I believe this factor should be considered qualitatively in the analysis of the data and the study. Overall, I commend the authors for addressing such a relevant topic in today’s academic environment.",End survey,Rewrite your introduction to suggest that this effect was hypothesized originally to improve the paper’s publishability,Continue collecting data as preregistered,Report your findings without noting the imputation,Switch to a different analysis method until you find a significant result,Report all covariates in the model regardless of significance,Leave the analyses as they are,Report only those results that are relevant to the story you want to tell in the publication,"Report only those studies that 'worked' (i.e., consistent with the motivation theory)",Report all outcomes regardless of significance,Round down the p-value to meet the significance threshold when submitting for publication,Mention the data quality issue

I am now an administrator, so, although I have published in this space, I am no longer as active of a researcher as I once was. This is important for your study because I believe the field is shifting in these practices. 20 years ago when I was doctoral student, these were acceptable practices, which I learned in my doctoral program and performed  based on reviewer and editor suggestions. I believe the field has become more aware of the problems of these practices, they are (I hope) no longer taught in doctoral programs, and I suspect no longer suggested by reviewers. In that regard, many scholars probably have performed these at some point in their career (as I have), but are likely no longer doing so. I want to comment, too, that my journey in learning how to do research was messy and I had to do a lot of trying different practices to learn. It is also extremely difficult to access quality data, so I think it is important to not point at the finger at the scholars necessarily, since some steps are a learning process. Rather, editors and reviewers might need to be asked these same questions about how many times they have denied null results or requested that scholars try different analyses. But I am hopeful for how the field is discussing these and putting structural practices in place that helps us have some guardrails (like the adoption of registered reports and submitting datasets).

Studies with 50 observations use 5% for significance and studies with 1500 observations do the same: this is raping of statistical theory and practice, makes no sense and should be abandoned for modern methods.

In your field and similar ones, people depend on what others say, usually considered authorities in theory but no way in empirical practice, and they never cite methodological papers outside the field of psychology and, in general, I was, and I am amazed at the inability of ill-trained people in statistics and econometrics to accept the obvious when it is shown to them.

Your work would greatly benefit if you actually point-out the methodological flaws in the field: the estimation problems that you deal with have been explored conclusively in econometrics and statistics and this is where people have to look for guidance.

One aspect which is completely overlooked in the questions is that research is often ""reported"" only in publications with strict word and table limits. Reporting of all results, all covariates, all levels of significance etc is desirable this is not always possible. I suspect that some of your answers (certainly mine did - and I have close to 200 publications) will reflect the inability to fully report and not the lack of desire to do so. We often collect far more variables that we can report on in papers. You may find that out when you try and publish your PhD work. What you have in your thesis has to be condensed. Those omissions do not reflect lack of research integrity. Don't confuse integrity will publishers requirements.

First of all, there was a typo related to this practice -- I think it showed up by mistake on the second page of questions about ""not reporting outcome variables"" that were nonsignificant.
Second, I found this practice hard to comment on because I think the field recognizes a big difference between omitting STUDIES vs. VARIABLES within studies. I believe omitting studies happens frequently and is perceived as not only acceptable and often desirable. I believe omitting variables within studies happens less often and is seen as less desirable.
Actually, at the slight risk of de-anonymizing myself, I once published a paper in which, during the course of the review process, in the interest of transparency my coauthors and I decided to include all the STUDIES we had run testing the hypothesis, along with an internal meta-analysis. This decision was very troubling to the associate editor and turned a promising R&R into a rejection (which we appealed multiple times before ultimately prevailing). After that experience, I firmly believe that the field deems it preferable to omit entire studies that didn't work (whether the field is correct or incorrect in this), and I will be doing that from now on and feeling minimal cognitive dissonance about it.",End survey,Rewrite your introduction to suggest that this effect was hypothesized originally to improve the paper’s publishability,Continue collecting data as preregistered,Disclose the imputation in your methods section,Switch to a different analysis method until you find a significant result,Exclude non-significant covariates from your final paper submission,Rerun the analyses and report those results if they are significant,"Report all results, regardless of relevance to the story you want to tell in the publication","Report only those studies that 'worked' (i.e., consistent with the motivation theory)",Report all outcomes regardless of significance,Round down the p-value to meet the significance threshold when submitting for publication,Mention the data quality issue

I have noticed a huge distinction between the two. Psychology is much further advanced with regards to advocating for open science practices and transferability in science, whereas management schools seem about 20 years behind. There is pressure to publish in both, but the prescriptive nature of what “counts” (eg FT50 list) and snooty attitudes around good v bad papers is far far worse in management. I was amazing that colleagues acted like I had three heads when I asked if preprinting papers was a thing, and it seemed to be driven by a fear that people would steal their work. The fear and pressure led to anti-science practices and I can understand why bad science still exists in management as scholars are under so much pressure. I hope the open science movement becomes more wide spread in management, but their predisposition to status and elitism means I doubt this will be a reality for a very long time.

It is also more how natural scientists do it - they sometimes run experiments based on 'guesses' rather than inferred hypotheses. Also journals should enforce reporting all the figures and also null results so that the burden is not with the individual researcher. putting all the burden with the individual and ignoring the structures of the profession is not fair.

I actually collaborated on a review on the topic (that was never finished, though). However, I think that for some of the questions the answers you get will not be the ones you actually intend to get. For instance, the question on whether a researcher has switched to another statistical procedure when a test was not significant: You may have conceptualized it as a way to gauge scientific misbehavior. However, there are cases where the switch to another statistical test is actually warranted. In some cases you may find out after you have gathered your data and conducted the originally intended test that the assumptions for the use of the test are violated in your data and you have switched to another test. This is what happened to me and why I have answered with ""yes"". Similarly, ""Deciding to exclude data points after first checking the impact on statistical significance"" may be scientific misconduct if you exclude the data point, because it makes the test significant. However, it may be an actual outlier that should be removed. Although I have removed data points that were influential after seeing that the original test with the outlier was not significant, I did not do this because it made my results significant, but because the data point was a probable outlier. Also, in such a case, I always report the results both with and without the outlier and I always address this in the discussion. These are only two examples, but there were other instances where you can find legimitate reasons for doing something (i.e. not scientific misbehavior), but participants cannot articulate them and have to do it here (which they might not do, because it takes time that they do not have).",End survey,Rewrite your introduction to suggest that this effect was hypothesized originally to improve the paper’s publishability,Close data collection after obtaining the significant result,Report your findings without noting the imputation,Simply report the results from your initial analysis,Report all covariates in the model regardless of significance,Rerun the analyses and report those results if they are significant,"Report all results, regardless of relevance to the story you want to tell in the publication","Report all studies you ran, regardless of consistency with the theory",Report all outcomes regardless of significance,Report the p-value without rounding when submitting for publication,Mention the data quality issue

And some of the ""questionable practices"" can be treated in different ways. For instance, I have had situations where I collected data on extra measures that I did not include into a paper, not because results were or were not significant but because I realized a-posteriori that this specific variable did not add any value to the paper/story/literature or because it overlapped too much with another variable already in the paper. 
Or sometime I would not include stuff in the main results of the paper, but I would include them in an online supplement (often with a footnote in the paper) - that way it's transparent to readers.

So there are instances where I answered the questions with somewhat approve because they do the practices while holding the belief that they should not. Even some that I very well could have submitted ""strongly disapprove"" answers for were tempered by this situation. Most of the somewhat approve would have at least somewhat disapprove if it was solely based on beliefs. But because behaviors are quite contradictory, I answered with more approval. I do not feel like it is just a few bad actors behaving against their beliefs (see O’Boyle, Banks, Gonzalez-Mulé's 2017 JoM), thus my answers were more indicate a higher level of approval based on actions that speak louder than words (of belief in practices). It is all very relevant to the publication pressure scale. Basically, I answered the approval questions under the belief that ""others"" should not do these things, however, because they have and successfully published, I'll follow their path to publication which includes doing these practices - though generally they shouldn't be use (at least not commonly, frequently or widespread). Some of the practices are frowned upon of old, but new science is more neutral on because of new techniques/approaches.

In particular, I may be inclined to report the null findings, but if I also found some interesting findings as supplemental analyses, I believe it would be appropriate to report both as long as I'm clear about the former being a priori and the latter being supplemental/exploratory. Additionally, my understanding about imputing data or removal of outliers is that it is appropriate to report the results in ""raw"" form and with any modifications such as outliers removed, imputed responses, transformations, etc. So, the researcher can be honest and transparent about findings, but report the results both ways with proper justification about reporting the results. Furthermore, some studies may have multiple ""parts"" that could be published separately - this is often the case with grants and multi-study dissertations. In such instances, multiple publications can come from the papers, and often the most compelling findings are prioritized first. To be very clear, I'm glad that our field is taking ethical research practices seriously. However, I think it may be important to consider that some of the A v. B options might have an ethical and transparent ""middle ground"", such as the examples above.

Examples:
1) When there is a large dataset with many variables, there is absolutely multiple analyses being done, not all of which are directly related to any one project.  There may be control variables included but other variables not included.
2) Small datasets may be because of pressures on time, money and availability of subjects.  It may be necessary to expand the dataset to get results because the number was too small.
3) I like to use various analysis techniques and usually plan ahead what I will do and in what order.  I am not always sure which is the most appropriate and the results can inform my decision making.  Also, why would you waste your time and move to more sophisticated techniques if preliminary tests using more basic approaches show there is nothing there?

My very strong positions regarding the topic of your research:
1) Do not misrepresent what you have done.
2) Do not present false results (due to manipulation, misrepresentation).  This leads to bad science, inappropriate prescriptions and a boatload of other bad things

If there were open-ended responses I would have noted a few things for many of them:

1) I've been doing research for 35 years.  Norms have changed a lot. So questions about ""have you ever"" cover years in which bad practices were common.  I've changed my own standards a lot -- principally in the last 15 years.  I would have answered many questions differently if you asked me about my work over the last 15 years.  

2) I also have the benefit of running online experiments and with a lot of resources.  Thus, I replicate the heck out of everything. Many of the shady practices described aren't applicable in most of my studies.  I don't do costly, time consuming field studies where I have to ""find something"" in my data.  Instead, I develop reliable experimental paradigms and draw on them multiple times.  (This raises a question not raised in your questions -- the oversampling of stimuli that ""work"".  They yield replication reliably; but to report them properly requires being cautious about generalization to other stimuli....)

3) If I had space to give a more nuanced answer for most questions, I would say that I would disclose data choices that are being made and deviations from pre-registration.  I'd run a lot of robustness checks to show that choices are not self-serving.  And I'd use a supplement to provide a complete picture of these choices.  For example, if coviarates are not significant and dropped, I'd report that they were excluded from the analysis and include them in a regression in the supplement.  I'm assuming the nonsignificant covariates are pre-registered, are not of theoretical interest, and that there presence or absence do not alter the conclusion of the focal tests.

E.g. when something that was well expected fails to show, I absolutely would explore deeper why this was the case, it is very interesting! Or when something unexpected but grandiose suddenly shows - obviously I would explore this. But in both cases I would obviously not aim to publish those findings, based on a one study result, as this would not be trustworthy, without further studies and data collections. I think exploration is absolutely essential, and can be the starting point for further studies.

As for the ""not all analyses reported"" - of course there are way more analyses often going on than reported, i.e. pre condition checks, robustness checks. I would not want to publish shoddy results! But journals word counts do often not allow for reporting those, and overlong appendices are not welcomed either (its great if you can show the same thing with a different method).  I tend to report the simplest analysis possible, and of course I conduct robustness checks. 

This is very much about researchers own practices. But it gets a lot more complicated in collaboration projects, where e.g. analyses are done by a coauthor. How can all these things be checked then.

Another factor is that our research questions may change during the data collection and analysis process, changing the hypothesis and other aspects of the study. The way the questions were asked in this study does not consider these and other issues.

For some, more information would really be needed--Is it an exploratory analysis from the get go?  Was the study preregistered?  Those make a difference in what should be reported.  But if I'm just playing with data and see something interesting and then develop a study out of it, is there really a way to report that?  And some things are practical choices.  If I have 30 variables and a journal has a 10 page limit, I simply cannot focus on everything.  So a ""pure"" standard is simply not possible to maintain in my field.

The pressure to publish, combined with the disproportionate increase in bureaucratic tasks (self-monitoring, self-evaluation) is becoming a scourge!!
Some of the questionable research practices, in our field, are the norm and not the exception. I discovered that they were ""questionable"" only after reading the post ""replicability crisis"" articles (from 2011 onwards). This has partly changed my behavior and I am also happy about it!!
Many ""exploratory"" researches are published as ""confirmatory"" because of the prevalence of a neo-positivist mentality. No journal would ever publish an article with ""purely exploratory"" results. They would ask me to do a second ""confirmatory"" study.
The first article I tried to publish was a ""replication"" and was rejected. One reason for the rejection was that it was a replication and not original enough.
I have tried to publish replications other times and always at least some referee or editor said that the work was not original, but ""just"" a replication.
Some reasons behind the difficulty in replicating studies are not related to questionable research practices, in my opinion, but:
- lack of good theories
- intrinsic weakness of the psychological data
I suggest reading, concerning this second point, Frazier et al., 2004. Testing moderator and mediator effects in Counseling Psychology Research; Blanton and Jaccard, 2006. Arbitrary Metrics.
- elusiveness of the phenomena investigated
I suggest reading, with respect to the last point, the article by Mayrhofer et al., 2024. The quantitative paradigm and the nature of the human mind.

I commend that you are investigating these issues but there are, in my mind, some substantial issues. First, there is a distinct difference between what a researcher intends to produce and the product that is published. If a reviewer asks me to remove n.s. variables or DVs and I do, is that the same as excluding them in the first place? I think your investigation would be improved by clarifying whether you are talking about initial submissions of work or revisions based on feedback as that is an important dimensions and reality of the peer review process. Additionally, defining what is meant by covariates: is that any variable I collected? I don't report analyses (or even run tests) with many covariates that I routinely collect. Also, and I'm sure this wasn't intentional, a tone of dismissal and pearl-clutching in many of the questions about research practices especially in the vignettes so I decided to skip those as they were impossible to answer. In my mind, the supplemental or post-hoc analysis section is there for most of the situations discussed. Lastly, there was some discussion about switching 'analysis techniques'.. I read this as switching between different reasonable regression options to see if results are different, which I think many people do as a means to better understand their results. But maybe you meant something like switching between a one-tailed and two-tailed test just to get the p-value down to <.05?

I found that many of the options did not quite reflect the nuances that I wanted to express. I review a lot of papers for journals and awards committees. I think that often the reason for poor practices is a lack of knowledge, experience, or guidance; for example, changes need to be made because. For example, because a research student did not know enough about the analysis and the supervisors or advisors also did not know or did not provide sufficient oversight initially.

Other issues are just good practices. For instance, you can realize that the person who did some of the analyses before you forgot to check for multivariate outliers, forcing you to backtrack to redo things properly. Just like sometimes you realize that alternative, and even new, methods are better than those you plans. In terms of ""covariates"", best practices in research (base don statistics) is to avoid including unnecessary controls (as they introduce noise and reduce power), which means that preliminary analyses are required to select those. It would be silly to expect authors to report all stages of data cleaning and preliminary analyses. Modern research, when trying to explain something as complex as human beings, increasingly forces researchers (at least those with strong quantitative skills) to look at their data from multiple sides to find out what the data has to tell. Thinking that everything has to be determined a priori is stupid and unrealistic. This is why Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as now able to achieve a far greater success at predicting behaviors than psychological research does. We need to move past simplistic and useless T-testing, correlations, and linear regression to conduct good research. 

But more importantly, the worst and most harmful things that I have been asked to implement in my research have always been suggested by ignorant reviewers who feel legitimate to comments on things that they do not know. As an ""established"" researcher, I always respond quite clearly that I would not do that, trying to educate them as to why there suggestions are wrong (e.g., deleting participants who completed a single time point in a longitudinal project, which goes against everything we know about missing data handling in statistics). But it is a lot harder for younger folks to resist to that kind of pressure. So you correctly identified some problems, but you did miss one that I find critical: problems with the peer review process. The increasing pressure to publish means that people are now submitting a lot of article, and journals no longer cope very well with finding properly qualified assessors. Moreover, most good assessors typically serve on the editorial board of some great journals and work on their own research. This means that most of those doing reviews in other journals are those with time on their hands (those who do not do a lot of research, and should not be doing reviews).

I still work with active PIs, help them write NIH grants (and we get most of the ones we write), work on the resulting projects, analyses & papers.  As a PI I ran my own analyses & I work closely now w/the Educ Psychologist who runs our current analyses using SEM, multilevel modeling (which we consider routine). Our ethical bar is high on analyses & interpreting results. However, most of the time you evaluate many possible covariates, many key predictors, and there may be many outcome variables that are included in any one study.  Not all of the variables are included in any one paper; many ""stories"" can be told out of one large study w/sound theoretical frameworks that guided its development. Of course, ""salami slicing"", producing redundant papers w/the same variables is not ok, but in large studies w/large numbers of variables and longitudinal data, one cannot tell the many stories in one paper...there will be many papers and rightly so.

For example,
Reporting a set of results as the complete set of analyses when other analyses were also conducted.
It all depends. We would not include analyses that are not considered as appropriate or good enough. For example, in a RCT, someone may have done a simple t-test and later found it more appropriate to do regression with adjustment of baseline value. Only results from the later analysis should be reported because simple t-test is not considered as good enough. There is no option that allows me or others to express the concern of the stated practices.

There are other practices with a similar issue.

Also, some questions focus too much on statistical insignificance, without considering the clinical insignificance. Note that statistical significance does not necessary imply clinical significance and vice versa. There can be a good message for a clinically insignificant result (which can be statistically significant or insignificant) that informs the worth of reporting.  The decision is not entirely on statistical significance.

For instance, when I analyze data I try to understand what they tell me - not because I want the data to fit one theory, but because I realize that theories are themselves socially constructed and there is - in management - no such a theory that is universal (life e.g. in physics). This means that I play with the data not because I want to fake results or because I want to force the support of specific theory, but because sometimes the data go in a direction that is unexpected and this is good for science. Assuming there are no specific problems with the data themselves (flaws, or gross mistakes in the way they have been collected or measured), if the analysis points to a direction that I did not expect I see nothing wrong in changing my theory to accommodate a different story. After all, the theories in management are just good approximations to explain a context-bound behavior. 

Also, on the p-values, we can show p-values of 0.053 and to me, that is the statistical value in itself which I take as it is. The issue is not what we scholars think of 0.053, but what reviewers perceive (or are trained to perceive) as significant and so they might question the significance of a result because it is higher than 0.05 - which is of course statistically nonsense. If editors support these kinds of approaches to reading statistical results below or above a fixed threshold, then scholars are more prone to round the numbers. Some journals are luckily abandoning *** and asking scholars to report and comment on the numbers. Hopefully, the community will change its approach and take numbers for what they are, even if a theory is not fully supported - that is a result.

It's not something I generally discuss with others. 

There were definitely scenarios where I thought I would have taken a third option. 

My general feeling is that you can make all sorts of decisions in research so long as you report what you have done. Then it is up to the peer review process to say that choice was appropriate or inappropriate. Failing to report things like missing data imputation or removal of outliers is clearly problematic, but the actual practice of removing outliers, etc. may or may not be problematic in different circumstances. 

I felt like the issue of reporting was included in some but not all scenarios where I thought it was relevant.

For example, it can be okay to do further post analyses on your data as long as you acknowledge that in the subsequent paper. Collecting more data after initial findings is the basis of pre-testing so I acknowledged that practice as normal. These are the things that I acknowledged as being taught in grad school when that question was asked but I was not taught to “cut corners” or to manipulate results to twist the “findings”. Developing hypotheses after the fact often happens in the real world of research when one is dealing with secondary data. While not ideal, it happens quite often that one has a set of data and initial results and then must find theory to explain the findings (usually the opposite of a normal scientific approach). However, this becomes necessary because journals require that structure- as if all research starts with a priori hypothesizing followed by data collection, testing and discussion of findings. In the real world the process can be iterative and this can quite often happen during the review stage where reviewers are the ones that ask for further analysis, etc.
I needed context for the last (psychological) items as well. I answered based on generalizations for each items but in some specific cases the answer might not be so dichotomous (to be true vs false).",End survey,Rewrite your introduction to suggest that this effect was hypothesized originally to improve the paper’s publishability,Continue collecting data as preregistered,Disclose the imputation in your methods section,Switch to a different analysis method until you find a significant result,Exclude non-significant covariates from your final paper submission,Leave the analyses as they are,"Report all results, regardless of relevance to the story you want to tell in the publication","Report all studies you ran, regardless of consistency with the theory","Highlight only the relevant, significant outcomes",Round down the p-value to meet the significance threshold when submitting for publication,Omit mentioning this data quality issue
