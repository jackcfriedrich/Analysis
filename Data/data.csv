Recruitment Statement for Research Participation

 
1. Jack Friedrich, Saint Louis University Psychology Graduate Student, is inviting you to participate in this research study.



2. The title of this study is More than Perverse Incentives: Questionable Research Practices in the Organizational Sciences. The purpose of this study is to better understand research practices used in the organizational sciences and their relationship with various social norms and experiences of publication pressure.



3. Your participation in this study will involve completing an online survey that will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. The survey will ask about your experiences related to various research practices and with publication pressure.



4. To be eligible for this study, you must be a researcher in the organizational sciences, have conducted quantitative research that involves null hypothesis significance testing, and be at least 18 years of age.



5. The risks to you as a participant are minimal. These include loss of confidentiality, boredom/fatigue, loss of time, and potential discomfort in answering questions about yourself. To minimize risk, your responses will be anonymous (no identifying information will be collected), the questions will not assess illegal or sensitive topics, and you are free to skip any questions you are uncomfortable responding to.



6. The results of this study may be published in scientific research journals or presented at professional conferences. However, your name and identity will not be revealed and your record will remain anonymous.



7. Participation in this study will not benefit you directly. Your participant may benefit others by helping us understand the relationships between publication pressure, social norms, and various research practices in the organizational sciences.



8. You can choose not to participate. If you decide not to participate, there will not be a penalty to you or loss of any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You may withdraw from this study at any time.



9. If you have questions about this research study, you can email Jack Friedrich at jack.friedrich@slu.edu. If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, you can call the Saint Louis University Institutional Review Board at 314-977-7744 and reference IRB #34401.

By clicking ""I agree,"" you are consenting to the conditions described above.",Have you conducted quantitative research that involves null-hypothesis significance testing?,Are you at least 18 years of age?,Which of the following best describes your current position?,Which of the following best describes your current academic appointment? - Selected Choice,Which of the following best describes your current academic appointment? - Other (please describe) - Text,How would you describe your gender identity? - Selected Choice,How would you describe your gender identity? - Other (please describe) - Text,Are you a member of an ethnic minority in your country?,List of Countries,"Dr. Patel is conducting research on the relationship between psychological safety and employee voice behaviors. Her planned analyses yield significant effects that are consistent with the literature but not particularly novel. During an exploratory analysis she discovers a significant, unexpected effect for certain groups in her dataset that is much more compelling than her original hypotheses and if it were the focus of the paper would likely strengthen the impact and publishability of her paper, particularly in a top-tier journal. In her place, would you: - 4","Dr. Garcia is conducting a lab study with two conditions. He is randomly assigning members to a leadership style and examining the impact of the style on team performance. The study is expensive and time-intensive to run. He preregistered that he would collect data from 40 teams, but he is running analyses after every fifth team’s data collection and obtains a significant result after collecting data from the 30th team. In his place, would you: - 4","Dr. Anderson finally finishes data collection for his study on factors contributing to burnout at work for a hard-to-study population, but unfortunately responses to many of his key variables have very high degrees of missingness. He decides to fill missing values in his dataset with estimated values, using a very common imputation method, but the degree of missingness in his data is slightly higher than recommended for use with this method. In his place, would you: - 1","Dr. Thompson is conducting research on the relationship between job satisfaction, work engagement, and the outcome of employee turnover. Upon running her analyses, Dr. Thompson is surprised to discover that the analysis she had originally chosen and that she believes is most appropriate for her data, a multiple logistic regression, returns a null effect. There are, however, several other plausible analyses she could run. In her place, would you: - 1","Dr. Lewis is running the analyses for her study on remote work. Her regression model includes a number of covariates that she hypothesized would be related to experiences of remote work, but she discovers that some of the covariates’ effects on experiences of remote work are non-significant. In her place, would you: - 1","Dr. Walker is studying the influence of personality traits on work-life balance. He obtains a non-significant correlation of r = .21 and p = .054 for what he believed would be his strongest result. After this result, he examines the scatterplot for the correlation and notices that a few datapoints that he could justify as outliers are preventing his results from reaching statistical significance. In his place, would you: - 1","Dr. Xu is studying the impact of job characteristics on employee strengths use. Some of her analyses yield negligible, non-significant effects. After reviewing her results, she believes the analyses that demonstrated null effects may not be relevant to the story she is telling in her planned publication. In her place, would you: - 1","Dr. Taylor runs multiple, well-powered studies testing hypotheses consistent with a very well-established theory of work motivation. Reviewing his results, Dr. Taylor is surprised to find that the results of some of his studies are non-significant and inconsistent with the theory. In his place, would you: - 1","Dr. King is applying for an academic job a few years after graduation and decides to publish her dissertation on the impact of workplace bullying on worker outcomes such as job turnover, satisfaction, and engagement. Several outcome variables in her original dissertation study were non-significant, and upon revisiting the topic in her dissertation, she deems them less relevant to the topic than she did when originally conducting the study. In her place, would you: - 1","The result of Dr. Bell’s key hypothesis test in his most recent research project examining predictors of organizational citizenship behaviors is right above the threshold for statistical significance at p = .053. He believes the result indicates there is an effect but worries that a technically non-significant finding will result in a rejection at the journal that best fits the study’s topic. In his place, would you: - 1","Dr. Carter’s paper exploring predictors of employee experiences of inclusion is ready for submission for publication when she discovers a data quality issue that could impact some of her conclusions and likelihood of publication; most of her participants gave inconsistent responses in her online data collection. She could recollect data, but it would require more additional time and resources than she has available. However, she worries that disclosing the issue would impact her likelihood of publication. In her place, would you: - 1","To ensure you are paying attention, please select ""Agree"".","What PERCENT of organizational scientists (e.g., management scholars, industrial-organizational psychologists, etc.)–that is how many out of 100–would you say have engaged in this practice on at least one occasion?
